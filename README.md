# The Dead Poets Society
---
### About
This is the members_only project for the Odin Project's curriculum, personalized with some poetic flare.

>In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
